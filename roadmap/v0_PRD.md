PropVerified — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Product Overview

Product Name: PropVerified (working title)
Category: Trust & Verification Platform
Target Users: Prop firm traders, trading educators, signal sellers, audiences consuming trading content

One-liner

PropVerified independently verifies real prop firm payouts using third-party payment trails (e.g. Rise, crypto), restoring trust in the prop trading ecosystem.

2. Problem Statement
Market Problem

The prop firm trading ecosystem suffers from widespread trust erosion:

Screenshots of dashboards are easily faked

MyFxBook and MT accounts can be cherry-picked

“$1M payout” claims are unverifiable

Audiences cannot distinguish real traders from marketers

User Pain Points
User	Pain
Traders	Hard to prove legitimacy without oversharing private info
Audiences	Cannot trust payout claims
Educators	Fake competitors dilute credibility
Platforms	No neutral verification layer
Root Cause

There is no independent, standardized payout verification layer — despite payouts being routed through verifiable systems (Rise, crypto, etc.).

3. Solution

PropVerified acts as a neutral verification layer that confirms money actually paid, not trading skill or performance.

Key Principle

Verify cash-out reality, not trading narratives.

4. Scope Definition
In Scope (MVP → v1)

Payout verification (Rise / crypto)
