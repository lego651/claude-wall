# TICKET-018: Launch Announcement

**Owner:** PM  
**Estimate:** 2 hours  
**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have)

## Goal

Public launch announcement to drive signups and subscriptions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Twitter thread** (suggested angles):
  - Problem: Hard to track prop firm trustworthiness.
  - Solution: Automated weekly intelligence reports (payouts + Trustpilot sentiment).
  - Features: Blockchain payouts, Trustpilot sentiment, weekly digest.
  - CTA: Sign up and subscribe to firms at [claude-wall.vercel.app](https://claude-wall.vercel.app) (or production URL).
- [ ] **Reddit** (where mods allow):
  - r/Forex, r/Daytrading, r/PropFirmHub (if it exists).
  - Follow each sub’s rules; avoid pure self-promo.
- [ ] **Optional:** ProductHunt launch (needs prep: tagline, description, media, hunter).
- [ ] **Monitor:** Signups, new subscriptions, and feedback (support, Twitter/Reddit replies).

## Links to Use

- App: `https://claude-wall.vercel.app` (or your production domain).
- Key pages: `/propfirms`, `/propfirm/[id]` (subscribe), `/settings` (manage subscriptions).

## Dependencies

- TICKET-017 (beta testing) can run in parallel or before; launch can follow or coincide with “beta open” messaging.
