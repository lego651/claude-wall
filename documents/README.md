# Documents folder

All markdown (`.md`) documentation for this repo lives here. Do not add doc `.md` files at the project root or in ad-hoc folders like `docs/` or `specs/`.

## Subfolders

| Folder | Use for |
|--------|--------|
| **`alpha/`** | Old and used files — reference material, completed designs, runbooks, docs no longer actively edited. |
| **`spikes/`** | New ideas and current investigation — spikes, explorations, deep-dives, in-progress analysis. |
| **`sprints/`** | Old sprint breakdowns — past sprint plans and retrospectives (archive). |
| **`current_sprint/`** | Current sprint only — active planning: `tasks.md`, `scope.md`, and other sprint-specific files. |

## Rules

1. **All `.md` files** → under `documents/` (in the appropriate subfolder).
2. **alpha** — reference / legacy docs that are still useful.
3. **spikes** — exploration and ideas; when done or adopted, move to `alpha` if it becomes reference.
4. **sprints** — historical sprint content; when a sprint ends, move `current_sprint/` contents here (e.g. by sprint name or date).
5. **current_sprint** — only the active sprint; typical files: `tasks.md`, `scope.md`, etc.
