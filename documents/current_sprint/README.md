# Current Sprint: Sprint 9 – Email Pipeline + Public Timelines & Industry News

**Active planning:**
- [s9_scope.md](./s9_scope.md) – Scope and success criteria
- [s9_tickets.md](./s9_tickets.md) – Tickets and implementation order

**S9 focus:**
1. **Email pipeline** – Receive firm marketing emails (Resend inbound) → detect firm → categorize/summarize (AI) → queue as draft → admin approves for weekly digest. Free/minimal cost.
2. **Public pages** – Firm content timeline per firm and industry news page (unauthenticated).

**Deferred:** Discord monitoring (lower priority); see [DISCORD-MONITORING-GUIDE.md](./DISCORD-MONITORING-GUIDE.md) when we pick it up.

**Sprint 8** (Firm Intelligence Content Expansion) is complete; docs are in [documents/sprints/](../sprints/) (s8_tickets.md, s8_summary.md).
