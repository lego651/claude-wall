# TICKET-004: Daily Scraper Cron Job
# Runs daily at 3 AM PST (11:00 UTC) to scrape 3 pages per firm for all firms with Trustpilot URLs.
# During PDT: 3 AM PDT = 10:00 UTC.
# Data is written to Supabase (trustpilot_reviews). No git push.
#
# Uses GitHub Actions (not Vercel cron) because the scraper needs Playwright/Chromium
# and runs ~2–5 minutes; Vercel cron has a 10s timeout on free tier.
