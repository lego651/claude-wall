# Sync Trustpilot Reviews (Daily)
#
# TICKET-004: Daily Scraper Cron Job
# Runs daily at 2 AM UTC to scrape 3 pages per firm for the5ers, fundingpips, fundednext.
# Data is written to Supabase (trustpilot_reviews). No git push.
#
# Uses GitHub Actions (not Vercel cron) because the scraper needs Playwright/Chromium
# and runs ~2–5 minutes; Vercel cron has a 10s timeout on free tier.
