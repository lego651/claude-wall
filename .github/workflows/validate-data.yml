# Validate JSON vs Supabase payout data overlap (PROP-018)
#
# Runs after historical sync (or on schedule). Fails if >5% of Supabase
# payouts for a firm/month are missing from JSON (indicates stale or failed sync).
#
# Requires: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (secrets).
# If secrets are not set, the script exits 0 (skips validation).
